  introduction: {
    p1: "Let me introduce myself. I'm M. Z. Haikal Hamdani. I'm currently a student in the Information Systems program at Nusa Putra University, after previously studying Visual Communication Design at the same university. Through this writing, I want to share my transformative journey about how the noble values of Nusa Putra University have profoundly impacted my life.",
    p2: "This story isn't about remarkable achievements or extraordinary accomplishments. It's the journey of an ordinary student who found strength and direction through the philosophy embedded in his educational institution.",

    title: "The Beginning of Tragedy",
    p1: "It all began when I was in the third semester of Visual Communication Design. Without warning, our family faced two severe blows simultaneously: financial bankruptcy and parental divorce. These two events, which shook the foundation of my life, plunged me into a deep depression and confusion.",
    p2: "As midterm exams approached, I had to face the bitter reality—my parents could no longer afford my tuition for the long term. Thoughts of giving up and leaving college began to haunt me, but on the other hand, there was a drive to keep fighting and find a way out.",

  disillusionment: {
    title: "When the Last Hope Faded",
    p1: "At that time, I hoped the campus environment could be a place of inner and moral healing. However, that hope was shattered. Instead of receiving support, I experienced bullying from classmates. More painfully, my ex-girlfriend, who was also in the same class, made threats of sexual violence and slander that wounded my dignity.",
    p2: "With a broken heart and wounded soul, I finally made the difficult decision to leave Nusa Putra University in October 2023. At that time, I felt there was no longer a safe place for me to grow.",

    title: "Rediscovering Meaning in Noble Values",
    p1: "After leaving campus, days passed without any sign of a way out of the tragedy that befell our family. For almost nine months, I was in a phase of self-discovery. In the midst of that darkness, I began to reflect and ask myself: what was my reason for choosing to go to college? What had I gained during my time at Nusa Putra University?",
    p2: 'In that reflection, my memory turned to the "Noble Values - Nusa Putra University" known as "Trilogi Nusa Putra". I began to review the moral messages contained in these values and realized how far I had strayed from these principles.',
    p3: "This awareness brought me to a deep reflection: all this time I had distanced myself from God, lacked devotion to my parents, and neglected to maintain relationships with siblings and the surrounding community.",

    p1: "One of the biggest changes in my life was how I began to see my mother's struggle in a different way. Previously, I often ignored how heavy the burden she carried every day. Now, I witnessed firsthand how she worked tirelessly, even when her body was asking for rest.",
